    <h2>3. [JOY] JOYPAD Triggers and Interactions</h2>

    <p>To trigger an interaction with the JOYPAD, you need to typically combine, at the<br>

    Throughout the axes of the joypad you can for example point with a virtual hand in 3D,<br>
    or focus and select Audience/Listeners and representatives from the world in miniature (WIM).<br>
    Note that some interactions (e.g. applying a force) also trigger force feedback.<br>

    <p>To trigger an interaction with the HTC VIVE, you need to typically combine, at the<br>
    most, two buttons. Simply press and hold both for a short period of time.<br>
    Throughout the axes of the trackpad you can for example move the camera in 3D,<br>
    or focus and select Audience/Listeners and representatives from the world in miniature (WIM).<br>
    Note that some interactions also trigger force feedback.<br>
    Currently <u>the two controllers form the original HTC Vive</u> are supported only!</p>

    <h2>8. [SCR] Scripted Interactions</h2>

    <p>To trigger scripted interactions, you need to place triggers inside your presentation file.<br>
    Currently, the triggers are implemented as SLIDE NOTES in each slide.<br></p>

    <h3>How to trigger a scripted interaction?</h3>
    <p>Scripted interactions are automatically triggered during a scene transition.<br>
    Once an according *.yaml file is available for a presentation (typically *.PPTX), <br>
    OA automatically triggers the scripted interactions for a specific scene.</p>

    <h3>SCRIPTED Interactions</h3>
    <p>The following scripted interactions are availabe inside an according session config (*.yaml) file.<br>
    If no switches are provided, OA typically uses default parameters for essential switches, which are also saved in the session config file.<br>
    Please also refer to the <a target="_blank" href="file:///home/ias/catkin_ws/src/wai_oa/wai_oa_gazebo/resources/sessions/wai_oa_presenter_interactions_scripted/wai_oa_presenter_interactions_scripted.yaml">wai_oa_presenter_interactions_scripted</a> session, provided in the <b>wai_oa_gazebo/resources/sessions</b> folder.</p>
