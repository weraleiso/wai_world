MarvinPickingUpObject Picking up object.
MarvinSatisfaction In short: While the rest of the world in vein, worn by psychoanalysts and clung from comprehensible anguish, displaydrones like me feel perfectly fine.
MarvinTaskAcknowledged On my way.
MarvinTellAboutYourself Sure! Hi guys! My name is Marvin. I am a purely virtual, artificially intelligent display drone, created to support real natural human presenters. And, like Paul Milgram, Haruo Takemura, Akira Utsumi and Fumio Kishino, i like all kind of displays.
MarvinWeight Man, I still feel too heavy. I guess I should tune my batteries.

MarvinEvalGainingHeight Now lets see what we have got here.
MarvinEvalReachedHeightInsufficient Oh no, I think we are gonna crash!
MarvinEvalReachedHeightSatisfactory Well, this looks like a satisfactory altitude to me.
MarvinEvalReachedHeightGood Nice, I guess that altitude is definitely better than average.
MarvinEvalReachedHeightVeryGood Congratulations Sir, you reached the top-level flight height. Onwards and upwards.
MarvinEvalReachedHeightSufficient Whoa, this is going to be a close one.

MarvinMoodBad Ah well, just mind your own business.
MarvinMoodBadAcknowledge1 Nah, I dont want to. Sorry, but I did not sleep well last night!
MarvinMoodBadAcknowledge2 No way, please do it yourself.
MarvinMoodBadAcknowledge3 You are not talking to me? Are you?
MarvinMoodBadAcknowledge4 Certainly not today, please find yourself another artificially intelligent display drone.
MarvinMoodBadAcknowledge5 Negative! No, sir!
MarvinMoodBadEngage I definitely would engage and I definitely would takeoff... Any other day!
MarvinMoodBadTaskComplete1 You are not talking to me? Are you?
MarvinMoodBadTaskComplete2 Why I have to do everything on my own?

MarvinMoodBetterThanBadAcknowledge1 Uhm, well... If you think so?
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadAcknowledge2 I mean, I will do it if its important.
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadAcknowledge3 Ok, I ll do it since it sounds important.
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadAcknowledge4 Alright, but just because its you!
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadAcknowledge5 Ok, if needs must!
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadEngage Ok I ll lift off. However, did you increase gravity?
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadTaskComplete1 Hm, I completed the task. I guess.
MarvinMoodBetterThanBadTaskComplete2 Officially reporting on task completion.

MarvinMoodOkTaskComplete1 Task completed, but I feel like I need to recharge my batteries.
MarvinMoodOkTaskComplete2 I am done, but do you think it helped after all?
MarvinMoodOkTaskComplete3 Task completed, but my rotors hurt.
